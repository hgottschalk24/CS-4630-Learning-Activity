## Dimensionality Reduction by PCA

**Overview**
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the Iris dataset to reduce its dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible.
The original four-feature dataset is transformed into two principal components and visualized to examine how well PCA separates the different iris species.
